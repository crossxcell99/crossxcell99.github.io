used for models that hold settings.\nAnother form of this idea is the representation of a model where only one instance can be set as 'active'\nor 'default'\nThere are a number of ways to achieve this, but the way I used recently, which uses GeneratedField from Django 5.0 felt more elegant to me. Here it is:\nfor settings:\n\nThats all. After a record is created, subsequent creation attempts will fail due to the unique constraint.\nNext, for cases where there can be only one default/active record:\nonly one active/default:\n\nThis exploits the way unique constraints are ignored when a column is NULL.\nNullIf sets _is_active to NULL when is_active is False. So the unique constraint is only active when is_active is True.\nHence multiple records with is_active set to False can be allowed, while only one record with is_active set to True is allowed.\nPS:\nDifferent databases have different requirements for GeneratedField, which should be reviewed carefully beforehand\n","id":"https://crossxcell99.github.io/blog/django-singleton/","title":"Singleton Model in Django"},"https://crossxcell99.github.io/projects/":{"body":"","id":"https://crossxcell99.github.io/projects/","title":"List of my public projects"}},"docInfo":{"https://crossxcell99.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://crossxcell99.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://crossxcell99.github.io/blog/django-singleton/":{"body":96,"title":3},"https://crossxcell99.github.io/projects/":{"body":0,"title":3}},"length":4},"lang":"English"}
